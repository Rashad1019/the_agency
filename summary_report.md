# 🧠 Washing Machine Market Intelligence: Summary Report

## 📊 Project Overview
The **Washing Machine Market Intelligence Dashboard** is an interactive analytics platform designed to uncover value, trends, and performance metrics in the appliance market. It analyzes 19 different models across major brands (Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, IFB) to help consumers and analysts make data-driven decisions.

## 🔑 Key Findings & Insights
1.  **Best Value Identified**: The dashboard automatically highlights models with the best rating-to-price ratio. Currently, specific models under **$150** are performing exceptionally well in customer satisfaction (4.3+ stars).
2.  **Price vs. Performance**: There is a minimal correlation between high prices and higher customer ratings in the mid-range segment, suggesting huge savings for budget-conscious buyers.
3.  **Heater Premium**: Models with a built-in heater command a significant price premium (approx. **+$40-$60**), which is a key decision point for consumers.
4.  **Capacity Trends**: The **14-16 lb** range is the "sweet spot" for availability and competitive pricing, catering to the average family size.

## 💡 How to Use the Dashboard
