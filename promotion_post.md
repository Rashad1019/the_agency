**Title:** Unveiling the Washing Machine Market Intelligence Dashboard 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project—a comprehensive **Business Intelligence Dashboard** for the appliance market! 📊

**🔍 The Problem:**
Choosing the right appliance is often based on guesswork. Consumers need data, not just marketing fluff.

**💡 The Solution:**
I built an interactive dashboard that analyzes 19 top models using real-time data to visualize:
- Price-to-Performance ratios
- Market dominance by Brand
- Feature premiums (e.g., Heater availability)

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
- **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Viz:** Chart.js for dynamic scatter & bar plots
- **Design:** Glassmorphism UI with Dark Mode
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
